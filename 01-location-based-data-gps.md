_Understanding the value of spatial data_

In any data collection process, the survey data itself is of the most concern to most analysts and managers. With a tree inventory that might cover species, tree diameter, health information, and more. But there's other information ("[metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)") to capture with digital tools. Smartphones have sensors to automatically log the date and time, who collected the data, and especially _where_ the data was collected.

The boom in location data available today has sparked an entire new market in [location intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_intelligence) &mdash; using location data and spatial relationships to derive new information. In the context of an inventory, the addition of accurate location data enables more value to be derived from data year after year.

With their pen-and-paper collection process, some people may say "But I _do_ collect location data, I write down an address with each report." While this is absolutely better than collecting nothing at all, let's compare digital capture with a traditional paper-based process to understand the possibilities unlocked with automated collection.

In a traditional paper-based process, location may be written down as a street address, an offset distance from a landmark, or something similar. Converting this into the digital world lets you harness sensors built into devices to do this for you, in a machine-readable format.

When you start capturing reliable location data, here are just a few of the advantages you'll see with a solid process:

* You can create summary reports on data by location - tree species by neighborhood, total density of trees per square mile
* Optimize your field crew distribution and zonal assignment based on productivity levels and quantities of data for future revisits

Of course, information can have value alone without location data, but the derivative analytical possibilities once your data is "spatial" are many. In addition to the "what" of your data (the basic attributes or form responses on a survey), the "where" component of spatial data gives insight for process improvement, reporting, analysis, and ultimately decision making. You can use location to optimize dispatch or assignment for field tasks, as well as to understand patterns in your results.

* Data is valuable even without location
* Context enables additional decision-making, reporting, analysis
* Workforce optimization
* Asset management teams concern themselves primarily with the assets themselves, not specifically the "where"
* Spatial distributions
* Spatio-temporal data - the time component is also critical
  * When was this tree planted?
  * When was it last maintained / surveyed?
* Geofencing
* Resource tracking not just for assets, but team management also
