# Collecting Data

* If you've designed and tested your app thoroughly, collection should be a breeze
* Capture photos first
* Then fill out the data
* Using "sticky defaults" speeds up data collection if there are common species observed in certain areas
* Tip: photo size can speed up syncing
* Tip: you can collect offline and sync later, or sync in real-time
