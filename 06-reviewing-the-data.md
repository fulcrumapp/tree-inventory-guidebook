# Reviewing the Data

* Proper QA is critical to maintaining an efficient feedback loop for data collection teams
* A good idea is to do real-time QA during the first day or two after deployment, to keep an eye on how things are going
* If you see common mistakes, missing pieces of data you'd like to collect, issues with photos - the best time to course correct is early in the project
* Look at the data on the map to see progress
* Keeping accurate, thorough metadata is important to improving your process
* Every tree point is timestamped and logged with a "last editor", so you can always see who did what and when
* This helps for finding repeated errors
