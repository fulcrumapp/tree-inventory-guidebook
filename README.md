# Tree Inventory Guidebook

It may be surprising, but many of the trees you see around your town didn't grow there naturally. Many cities and towns maintain street trees as part of the urban landscape of city centers for beautification, shade, and a host of other reasons. In larger cities the inventory of trees maintain can grow into the hundreds of thousands. In many places there are arborists on staff dedicated to the upkeep of urban forests. An efficient, thorough management process for tree inventories is critical to delivering on the promise to taxpayers to create livable, enjoyable spaces.

Some of the advantages of city street trees in communities are lesser-known, but of critical importance to residents. Urban trees help to filter stormwater runoff and prevent erosion. They increase property values in both residential and commercial settings. When planted along residential streets, they can even provide a natural traffic calming mechanism that's far more enjoyable than uncomfortable speed humps or curb extensions.

The planting, removal, and replacement of trees is only part of the battle. You also need an effective set of tools and data management processes. Here are some of the things made possible if you've got a current, accurate database of trees:

* Providing data for urban planning / design projects
* Preventing the spread of plant disease
* Managing maintenance cost
* Calculating carbon sequestration
* Understanding storm liability of damage from wind or falling trees

This guidebook will help parks departments, arborists, and forestry managers to build effective data collection practices.
